CAPSTONE OVERVIEW

Capstone project name:
Let's Play!

Capstone project Description:
This project aims to build a simple web application that allows a single player to practice the popular American game Jeopardy. It has a similar make and feel of the real game with the real clues.

The game part of the project uses the APIs from http://jservice.io/.

It will make 2 API calls from the data source:

Get random categories from /api/categories
Fetch the clues for each category generated from /api/clues

Project Goals
Create a game
See the Jeopardy table with 6 randomly chosen categories and clues with the money amount
Choose one clue each time
Enter the answer and see if it's right
Checks the scores based on right/wrong answers
Be able to exit the game at any time and starts over
Add a timer to count down answering time

STRETCH GOALS
Add second API to greet users in their native language on the home page
Add third API to direct users to Wikipedia to learn more about the specific answer
Add sound effects for click buttons, time-out, and correct and wrong answers
Add a high-score counter 
Fix it to where you can get the correct answer without using "A/AN"
